Place: Hannover
Date: September 28, 1993
This is a sad and a happy journey. The beginning is sad, but then it becomes a regular holiday. I do
not quite know where to classify the roots part of it. We’ll see. The are three of us - Alice, Babi and I.
As always, we are happy to have Babi with us. She is an ideal travelling companion. Another short
introductory notice:
This will not be a daily diary. From time to time I shall jot down notes in the diary as time permits and
inclination dictates.
The journey started on Sunday, September 26, 1993 at 3 a.m., the day after Yom Kippur. This is
also what caused the early start for originally we were scheduled to leave at 10 a.m.
But there was a silver lining: (I am on silver linings!) For the result was that we were in Hannover by
10 a.m. and thus we were able to visit Bergen-Belsen the same day, leaving all of next day for
tourism and shopping. I am not sure which comes first.
The first noteworthy thing was the train-ride from Frankfurt to Hannover. Europe has rejuvenated its
train system and there is a network of fast comfortable trains in Germany. We bought a five-day first
class ticket and got a very comfortable club-car and breakfast served in our seats! The train rode on
average speed of 250 km per hour and you didn’t even notice. And you could watch the beautiful
countryside sliding by, As an alternative to plane noises, It is highly recommended.
The purpose of our stop in Hannover was to visit Bergen-Belsen, the concentration camp where my
mother died of typhus I was told. I have no desire whatsoever to visit concentration camps, but I feel
I do have the moral obligation to remember my beloved by saying Kaddish, the ancient prayer for the
dead, where they died, over their grave, so to speak. But Alice is right: we cannot turn our journey to
Europe into a procession from one graveyard to another, There are simply too many of them. So this
is my first and last visit to Bergen-Belsen. It is a good thing that Alice and Babi were with me,
though.
On the way to the hotel (Hotel Kröner, very comfortable), we got an elderly lady taxi driver who was
willing to take us to Bergen-Belsen, if we stayed a short while. But somehow she raised Alice’s
hackles with her ‘’, so we dropped her. So what did we get instead? A leftist Iranian refugee! an
opponent of Hameini, who murdered his wife and brother. He was a mixture of information and
ignorance.
He did not know about Bergen-Belsen to begin with. But once he found out about our destiny, he
insisted on coming all the way with us - as he said - what what the fascists did to the Jews was a
crime against all, against the human race.
Bergen-Belsen is about 50 kms north-east from Hannover, a national park with a small museum. The
park is a dignified place; mass graves in an autumn flioge, with a few simple memorials. Stone
inscriptions of how many people are buried in the graves; a large, simple wall with inscriptions in
several languages, including Hebrew and Yiddish; and a small stone column dedicated to the Jews
who died there. This is where I said my Kaddish for Rozika Hirschenhauser and sang my El Male
Rachamim.
We went into the museum but I fled after two minutes. For a horrible moment I imagined that I will
recognise my mother’s face in one of the very realistic photographs exhibited. Enough was enough.
*****************************************
On Monday, September 27, 1993, we went shopping and touring. Hannover has an enormous
shopping area, part of pedestrians only zone, they claim the biggest in Europe. I told Alice and Babi
to buy here for after this everywhere there will be less choice - and more expensive. So they tried,
but it wasn’t really a spree.
The tourist part of Hannover is negligible. There were really only two noteworthy sites: the four
models of Hannover - under an enormous cupola of civic pride - models dated 1689, 1939, 1945
(85% destroyed) and today. The second was the Herrenhausen summer residences of the Kings and
Electors of Hannover, a very beautiful rococo garden, enormous, well-kept, with the tallest artificial
water-geyser in Europe.
To Time to roust Alice & Babi out of bed for the next leg of our journey.

*****************************************
On Tuesday, September 28, we left for Weimar, on the way to Gera, our second goal in honouring
the past. Another pleasant, enjoyable train ride, of 3½ hours, to Magdeburg. We stay one night at
the Weimar Hilton, a new and elegant hostelry, and under what is called a family plan, quite
reasonable.
Weimar is a lovely old town - even the Communists did not ruin it. We took our customary sight-
seeing tour and got lucky. In Weimar, sightseeing is done in minibuses, caravans of 8 seaters. When
we asked for an English guide, a young bus driver in a second car volunteered - and we ended up
we asked for an English guide, a young bus driver in a second car volunteered - and we ended up
having a minibus to ourselves. The young guide had a good sense of humor, an enthusiastic about
showing us the sights, in short, an ideal guide.
It is amazing how many great men this little town attracted: Goethe and Schiller, Bach, Hummel,
Wieland, Cozelne, Herder. The Weimar Republic was founded here, with the Weimar Constitution.

But there is also a dark side to all this enlightenment. Buchenwald Concentration Camp was just
outside town; The guide also told us that Weimar became a stronghold of the Brownshirts quite early
in the 1920s. Frick, the future Minister of Interior of Hitler was already a leading political figure in the
1920s.
Our friend, the guide, recommended a restaurant near the Herder church called “Zum Zwiebel” (The
Onion). Again we could only thank him, for it turned out to be a kind of local pub with wonderful
food. We were approached by a “friendly” young man whom we all suspected of nefarious
intentions. But he must have given us up as a bad job; instead he went up to the WC above us,
climbed out the window and shimmied down a tree into the back garden.
On the other hand, breakfast at 27 DM per person seemed a bit steep to us so we left the Hilton in
the morning and had breakfast at the station.
*****************************************
On Wednesday, September 29, we reached Gera at 10 a.m. We went from the railway station to the
cemetery and back and kept the taxi waiting. There wasn’t really anything that interested us in Gera,
except Gyula bácsi’s grave.
Gyula bá’csi was my mother’s brother. A handsome man, an officer in the K. and K., army of kaiser
Franz Josef, he married the rich Lili Reich (see the Hirschenhausers). They had no children, so he
was extra nice to his sister’s boys. Now I know that he was taken in 1944 with a forced labour
battalion to Gleina near Gera and that is where he died, officially of “Durchfall”, but really of
starvation. He and 445 other Jews who died in this camp were cremated and buried in a common
urn in the cemetery of Gera.
How do I know this? The local Germans kept a list of the dead (They still have it) and somebody
brought that list back with him in 1945 and it was published in a Hungarian Jewish newspaper — and
I happened to read it at the time.
I was always determined to visit his grave. I loved him - and there is no one else to say Kaddish over
him. But as long as Gera was a town in East Germany, it was impossible. But after the change of
regime I wrote to the Bürgermeister of Gera and - to my surprise - he wrote back that yes, they have
located him, as one of the 446 buried in a common grave after cremation.
It was much as I expected. Mr. Neupert the custodian of the graveyard waited for us and took us to
the grave erected above the ashes of the 446 (see the picture below). For the second time I said
Kaddish and sang “El Maleh Rachamim”, on Germany’s blood-soaked soil.
I felt the urge to tell Mr. Neupert something about Gyula bácsi; I thought this guy should know that
the handful of ashes in his care was once a man of some importance — a human being, a thinking
man, to personalize this uptil-then impersonal “solution”. So I told him that Gyula Hirschenhauser
was the owner of an estate that he was the first to experiment with the growth of rice in Mittel-
was the owner of an estate, that he was the first to experiment with the growth of rice in Mittel-
Europe (a failure) and oil-bearing plants (a success). And slowly a living image was there before us*
*You will find among my papers a list of the 438 Jews buried in Gera, on which I worked laboriously
to bring it into order and give it to Yad Vashem.

So we proceeded to Dresden. It was Babi’s idea to break our journey in Dresden, so as to shorten
the hours spent on trains. I must say the combination of train journeys and taxis worked out well
except for one - unexpected - aspect: the difference in level between the train platforms and the
stations themselves. In every station we found carriages for our suitcases. But at the end of the
platform we had to abandon them and go downstairs - or upstairs - with all our luggage. This
procedure became especially onerous when we had to change trains.
Place: Dresden
Date: 1993

Dresden still lives under the shadow of the aerial destruction of February 1945. When 85% of it was
levelled, including the historic quarter. You encounter it still everywhere: in the ruins not yet
restored, in the explanations of the guides – and in the feverish yet punctilious reconstruction of
ancient buildings, for the dominant object of Dresden’s sky-line is the crane.
I felt significant remnants of the communists still in Dresden from the registration form in the hotel
(What was your wife’s maiden name, Where was she born) to the couldn’t–care-less-just–give-me-
your-money – tourist style of the Stadtrundfahrt. It was a disgrace: recorded explanations, often not
synchronized with what you saw, stopping nowhere, battling rush-hour traffic.
The only real treasure of Dresden is the picture gallery of old masters in Der Zwinger, which we
managed to see the next day, September 30. It is an absolute treasure house of Rubens, Cranachs,
Rembrandts, other Dutch masters; at today’s prices, that storehouse must be worth several billion
dollars.
{image-7}
One thing gets rubbed under your nose, when you wander around this part of Germany: the history
of the many independent fiefdoms that made up Germany until unification in the XIXth century. You
had kings, dukes, electors, princes, margraves as rulers of these small or large territories. These
small fiefdoms then influenced the history of their larger better established relatives — for they all
intermarried. Thus a small prince in Hanover became the King of England and founded the
Hanoverian line of Georges. In Weimar we learned a lot about a very rich Russian princess who
married the local ruler. She used her enormous wealth for civic improvement - for example she built
a small theater in neo-classical Greek style which was used for public readings, for in the XIXth
century public readings - and discussion of books was an important part of the cultural scene. In
Dresden you hear a lot about August the Strong (August der Starke), possibly a minor king, but a
major influence in the development and beautification of Dresden.

So, on this day, September 30, we ended the German part of our trip and rode the train into - what is
called today? - the Czech Republic. Prague is still Prague, probably the most beautiful capital of
Europe. Much has been repaired since we saw it in May 1990 when we found it shabby and
criminally neglected. But capitalism brings with it much that is negative: commercialization,
exploitation, deepening social cleavages.
On our first evening we went to a concert of the Israel Chamber Orchestra with Shlomo Mintz, who
played brilliantly. The restored Rudolfinum as a concert hall is an aesthetic pleasure in itself.

*****************************************
On Friday, October 1 we were tourists. We missed the morning grand tour (which was lucky), so we
went first to the Jewish quarter: Alt–Neu Shul, cemetery, museums, old synagogues. It is all still
interesting and touching. But the first impressions of the first time were more vital, they touched you
deeper. Déjà vu cannot help bring down the vividness of impressions.
The story of the Pinkas Synagogue is worth noting. In the fifties the Jews decorated the walls of the
Pinkas Synagogue with the names of some 78,000 Jews from Bohemia and Moravia (note: No
Slovakia!) who died in the Holocaust. Then in 1967, after 1967 when Czechoslovakia broke off
diplomatic relations with Israel, the bloody miserable Communists on some pretext wiped the names
off. It takes the malice of an unaccountable apparatchik to think of such a step and then carry it out.
His bosses would only smirk with satisfaction.
In 1989 the Jews decided to redo the whole thing and when we visited there, the printer was at work
and several thousand names had been redone.

We became lucky with the guide of the afternoon grand tour. A retired diplomat full of wit and charm
– he walked us off our feet, but it was worth it. His guidance was simple, interesting, funny. He is a
man of my age, in good shape, but guiding day–in, day–out is - I imagine - not an easy job.
The main part of the tour was a detailed stroll through the Hradčany – the Castle Compound, which
is a very well preserved succession of a very old cathedral (St. Vitus), other churches, royal palaces,
other palaces of nobles from the XVth to the XVIIIth century, Stories of defenestrations a peculiar
Czech way of getting rid of enemies.

*****************************************
Saturday, October 2, was a mixed day. It started with a visit to a bureaucratic railway station, where
we bought the tickets to Vienna: first class, $30 per person, reserved seats, that’s the good point.
Why bureaucratic: first you look for information; when you find it they send you to International
Information. They send you to the ticket counter, where you re-queue after having queued up at the
wrong ticket counter. You see there is a special unique ticket-counter for international travel;
something nobody bothers to explain. The next customer takes 10 minutes, since the tickets have to
be made out by hand as well as by machine. You are finally the lucky holder of a ticket – but no!
There is still another far-away counter for seat reservations.
Then we went shopping, not a great success — one training for Itai. From there we took the tram to
Hradčany, to the Strahov cloister, church and library. It is an absolute delight; two magnificent
enormous rooms, filled to the roof with ancient tomes, in the middle globes and astrolabes! You can
truly imagine the monks and the great scientists of the time – Tycho Brahe, Kepler – at work in these
settings. The church is just as beautiful.

We then tried to go to a performance of the Magic Lantern Theater. But of course all tickets sold out
days earlier, so we settled for a leisurely supper at John Bull – a very good place – and a leisurely
stroll through the center of town.
*****************************************
Sunday, October 3, We were sort of at loose ends but it turned into a full, satisfying day.
!״borzasztó״ - To begin with, we went to an exhibition of contemporary Czech artists
But there we found out where the better stuff is, so we went to a cloister near the Moldau where the
XIXth century Czech paintings are, in particular those of a Mánes family. But we also saw paintings
and sculptures by a Levy and a Pinkas.

Then we went to the old Jewish cemetery where we couldn’t get in the first time because of Sukkot.
I wouldn’t go in, because they charge 80 crowns now for a visit. It was very unreasonable, because it
is only $3, but by this time I was very annoyed with the local habit of charging for everything they
can.
I forgot to mention: after the first night we decided to boycott taxis, this variety of the local robber-
barons. Having been cheated twice we switched to the trams - a very efficient and cheap way of
getting everywhere.
Then we meandered once more through the beautiful Staré Město (Old Town Square).
In the evening we went to hear Mozart’s Requiem in the Baroque St. Nicholas Cathedral near Malá
Strana (there are two), very beautiful sight - and sound-wise. Then we had a late supper in the
Klášterní Vinárna, one of the better restaurants of Prague, with a past.
*****************************************
Monday October 4, was moving day from one country to another, from Prague to Vienna.
It started with a last shopping spree, no spectacular results, so we were stuck with a lot of unwanted
Czech crowns but our landlord solved the problem. He also took us to the railway station - a good
man.
We again learned the truth of the old adage: when you see something you like, do not hesitate - buy
it, because it won’t be available the next time. Sure enough, when we first crossed the Karlovy Most
(the Charles Bridge), which is a souvenir fair nowadays, both Babi & I liked the works of an elderly
aquarel painter who painted his views of the bridge in front of your eyes, with simple means. But we
thought we’ll have a look at the rest and then return to buy some of his aquarels. But we did not
return the same day and the next day he wasn’t there.
We took the train to Vienna at 1 p.m. As always, a comfortable, enjoyable ride. In Vienna, we are
always welcome at the Gross pension. They are “Unsereins”: come from the same background,
speak the same languages, are always helpful. It is in the nucleus of a newly reforming Jewish
ghetto in Vienna, where the old ghetto used to be.
*****************************************
It was an incredible summer day on Tuesday October 5, blue skies, warm, a pleasant breeze.
This was, ironically, “shopping day” with not bad results. It seems that even in expensive Vienna you
can buy things cheaply. Alice bought 2 pairs of shoes! Though the second was a pure “trampli” pair
for walking and to hell with looks. But we also wandered around Vienna’s beautiful historic inner city
– and we had coffee and cakes at Demel’s, a must in the Geist family.
Chaim Eliad listened to my advice and is also staying here with some friends. We had a long chat. He
has a lot of worries in his family. He hopes to get a good job for pension time, because he needs the
money.

*****************************************
P.S. After all my scheming I walk into a theatre tickets agency and get - for a slight surcharge -
tickects for the Volksoper. I have learned my lesson: trying to get tickets in accordance with tourist
instructions is bureaucracy and doesn’t work; ticket agencies are free enterprise and it works.
*****************************************
Wednesday, October 6, was basically a tourist day, though shopping was not neglected either.
In the morning we went to the Kunsthistorisches Museum. During our recent wanderings we have
avoided museums, but this is special: it is one of the treasure houses of the world. On top of it, there
was a special exhibition called “The Torah and the Crown” with some very beautiful Jewish
Ceremonial art mostly filigré works from Poland, XVIIIth–XIXth century.
But of course, the highlights are the Breughels; they have just about every famous Breughel and all
the Dutch greats!

Then we proceeded to Schönbrunn on a beautiful summer day. We sat in the magnificent garden full
with flowers next to the manicured alleys while Babi enjoyed the tour of the royal palace.
In the morning I had to rush to the Slovak embassy, because we decided after all to go to Bratislava.
The two embassies – Consulates are still together one counter next to the other. Visa cheaper than
in Israel, because it turns out here they all give short visit visas.
The day ended with shopping (without me!) while I meandered around the inner city. Had another
pleasant surprise: we don’t have to pack the Grosses let us stay in the room, leave our things.

*****************************************
Gross, as always, came up with a special solution for Bratislava, whose name is Shragge. He is a
retired Jewish bus driver (must be the only one of Jewish origin in all of Middle Europe). He drove us
from Vienna to Bratislava and back and drove us the whole day around Slovakia - all this for $100.
He is a real treasure.
The deal almost didn’t come off, because Shragge insisted upon going to “Yiscor” but I worked it
out with him by starting earlier than planned and letting him go to “Yiscor”.
Shragge turned out to be a fount of information on all matters concerning Jews in Slovakia: how
many there are, who is the head, where there are synagogues, graveyards, kosher kitchens. A very
decent guy, of real treasures.
So, on Thursday October 7, we went to Bratislava for a day and a half. We first met Anemie, who —
considering the alternative — did not look as bad as we expected. Then Draushka came with her two
little blond daughters, very sweet. Then she quickly dumped the little one on grandma (who, with
the surprising intelligence of little children, started howling the moment she sensed mother is going
to dump her) and we did our first tour in Bratislava. Still provincial, but it is now the capital of a new
country and there is lots of building, cleaning, etc. The Danub Hotel has become so expensive that
we abandoned the idea of staying there and accepted Anemie’s offer of staying with her the night.

Then we started our tour of “roots”, with Shragge, first station: Malacky.
Malacky looks better than 3 ½ years ago, much has been cleaned up, renovated. But it is still a small
town, nothing notable (with the exception of the synagogue turned into art school). And the
wonderful workers’ restaurant has closed down - the victim of progress.
Place: Malacky

Then we proceeded through a mountain pass to Pezinok, where we met Peter Sidlo and again his
family. He just started on rebuilding and enlarging his house and his two brothers-in-law are helping
him (like it used to be in previous years).
Then we went to Trnava (Nagy Szombat) where Alice was hidden in a cloister. It is a lovely town, a
centre of Catholicism. It used to be a centre of Jewish learning as well. There are the remains of two
large Jewish synagogues, both of them in the process of restoration.
Shragge brought us back to Anemie’s brand-new flat in a brand new house, a high-rise, more
central, but the finish is horrific, everything pre-fabricated cheapest of the cheapest kind. They had
to double lock every door, because the cheapest fixtures disappear.
{image-21}
Anemie is a curious mixture. She is obsessed with her illness — that is not surprising. They are
obviously doing not badly: Peter is building a bigger villa; they bought the new flat, and they still
own the old one which according to them is worth about $20,000. Anemie saved for us some old
photographs when they cleared out the attic in Pezinok. She wanted to give us a set of fish-knives,
antiques from England, but we refused: who uses fish-knives nowadays? But we did accept another
antique, a silver plate. I have the impression - maybe I am wrong - that she feels some of these
things should stay with Alice for a mix of complex reasons. Anyway Alice can stop muttering about
her Persian carpets every time she sees them in Anemie’s house: the silver platter is certainly worth
more than worn-out Persian carpets.
*****************************************
The next day, Friday October 8, we toured Bratislava with Anemie and her husband, from the Hrad
(fortress) that dominates the town to the small new Jewish Museum. We started in the Jewish
cemetery, where I said Kaddish over Alice’s father’s grave (my third Kaddish).

Then a surprise awaited us: an enormous Israeli flag at the Hrad, next to an enormous Slovak flag.
Peres? Ezer travelling? It turned out that our new ambassador to Vienna, Dr. Govrin, called upon the
Slovak President (I know him and recognized him when he came out to give an interview). I was
rather surprised that he makes official calls on what is still a Jewish holiday in Chutz le-aretz, but it
is his problem. He is lucky that the orthodox are not around to protest.
In the evening our first show in Vienna: The Land of Smiles (A Mosoly Országa) by Lehár. A good
performance, though the tenor had a strong but unpleasant voice.

*****************************************
On Saturday, October 9, we used the early hours for shopping. While I was waiting for Alice & Babi
in the Kärntner-Strasse a lovely young Viennese approached me and started a conversation by
saying: “You are Jewish, aren’t you?” When I answered in the affirmative this surprising person
introduced herself as a tourist guide and somehow charmed me into giving her my card as well. That
was a mistake: as the conversation progressed, it became clear that she is some kind of religious
nut. Why don’t we accept Jesus as the Messiah, etc. That’s all I need, somebody pestering me in
Jerusalem with ideas of missionism in her pretty head.
For the first after close to two weeks under way it rained, so Babi and I used the opportunity to go
on a “roots” excursion while Alice stayed at home. We went to Darwingasse 34 (a new building) and
to my old school and to the Praterstern. After that we went to Demel again and bought some very
expensive cakes and finished up by wandering through the royal compound, the Heldenplatz.

Sunday, October 10 was another sunny, mild day, ideal for touring and nature. We combined it by
going up to the Kahlenberg and then Grinzing, as well as to Mr. Strauss (our Landsmann) in the
Stadtpark. I can attest that the Heuriger (this year’s wine) is just as good as it ever was. It goes
down like velvet, you don’t even feel it, but it still has its kick and you are not quite steady on your
feet after 3 big glasses.
In the evening a performance of Elisabeth, a modern Austrian musical based upon the story of
Queen Elisabeth (“Sissy” – Franz Joseph’s wife). Now the music may be mediocre as Alice thinks (I
thought it was quite pleasant and bearable considering it is modern). But the staging! In all honesty I
can say I haber seen theater staged so brilliantly in my life. In particular we were impressed by the
“horses scene” (all actors riding a toy horse) and the “Velodrome” scene (all actors riding velodrome
carts) while discussing Sissy’s troubles.
*****************************************
Again I almost forgot: we visited the Hundertwasser House, which has been turned into a tourist
industry of its own. Hundertwasser is a half-Jew, the most famous artist of present-day Austria who
is also an architect. The combination caused him to turn into the Gaudi of present-day Austria. His
paintings are a riot of colours, a true heir of Klimt, and his houses are peculiar, individualistic,
idiosyncratic, for example, no windows is the same shape as the others; in his coffeeshop water
trickles across the counter, and his twisted columns are a constant notion of mosaic, puzzling, and
other materials. Definitely worth a visit.

The trip to Budapest by train on Monday, October 11 was very pleasant and we had another two
sunny summer days in Budapest.
Eva waited for me at the Keleti and we went straight to Robi’s grave. It is made of a reddish granite,
very dignified. I said my fourth Kaddish and “El Male Rachamim” on this journey around Europe.

Then we went to the area of Váci utca, where Alice spent considerable amounts of money on a
.kalàt” and a new pair of complex glasses – probably of very good buy״
Budapest has not changed much since our previous visit. By now we are used to the process of
sprucing up that goes on all over formerly Communist Europe. I enjoyed myself in the bookshops,
bought a few books, a Kálmán videotape, paprika. The rest is negligible.
In the evening the Keili’s came to see us, and Feri. Gyula turned up – but no Eva, until it came to be
quite painful and embarrassing. She turned up five minutes before we went to sleep. It was enough
to spoil another perfect outing. She apologized profoundly the next day, but it still left a bad taste in
the mouth. Eva was very embarrassed (her mother).

There was no point in doing shopping the next day, Tuesday October 12, so we went to have
breakfast at Gerbeaud’s – as is customary – and then up to the ancient historical centre in Buda,
around the royal palace. The circle of ancient Buda, Mattyás Cathedral, Halászbástya and Royal
Palace is always worth seeing, and the beauty of the day helped.
We went to have lunch in tourist but pleasant Matyáspince, always good food. The Sholet is
especially good. And a pleasant train journey back to Vienna on the Orient Express!
*****************************************
This journey came to an end on Wednesday October 13, 1993. We returned to Vienna and flew
back to Israel with EL-AL. Mishi waited for us with the two picinkos who had worked hard and
decorated our flat for a real welcome. It is wonderful to have such a family.
The three of us got along famously. We enjoyed each other’s company. My daughter is a wonderful
travelling companion – cheerful, understanding, considerate. And, as always, it is good to be home.
